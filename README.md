# Aleksi Lummila -🏳️‍🌈 Game Development 🏳️‍🌈
Art speaks and I create art through the medium of games. I currently study IT engineering, majoring in game production. My main strengths are artistic integrity, accessibility first -approach and solid fundamental understanding of programming principles. I am an unyieldingly inclusive, pro-queer feminist.
### **NO PROJECT OF MINE USE GENERATIVE AI AT ANY POINT OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT.**

## Finished projects:
### [GirlyPOPPED!](https://heyitsyoker.itch.io/girlypopped) | A casual feminist top-down shoot-men-up done in Unity 6.

### [Put To Sweep](https://heyitsyoker.itch.io/put-to-sweep) | A retro horror game made in UE5, where you control a robot vacuum to free imprisoned animals.
